# N Queens

## Description
The N Queens puzzle is a classic chess problem that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project implements a solution to the N Queens problem using backtracking algorithm in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4+
- The first argument must be the board size (integer N)
- If the argument count is wrong, print "Usage: nqueens N" and exit with status 1
- If N is not an integer, print "N must be a number" and exit with status 1
- If N is smaller than 4, print "N must be at least 4" and exit with status 1
